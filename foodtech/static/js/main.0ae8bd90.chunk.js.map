Сперва, нужно понять то,\n         * как работает навигация в кишках connected-react-router и history.\n         * Предположим, мы хотим перейти на другую страницу. Для этого\n         * dispatch'им push action react-connected-router'a с типом @@router/CALL_HISTORY_METHOD\n         * который подхватывает router middleware и вызывает\n         * соответствующий метод (push) у библиотеки history.\n         * В результате чего history меняет урл через History API браузера\n         * и обновляет свой стейт. После оповещает слушателей, подписанных на это.\n         * Внутри connected-react-router'а вызывается обработчик, который подписан\n         * на изменение стейта (локального, внутри библиотеки) history.\n         * Он dispatch'ит action, с типом @@router/LOCATION_CHANGE, который должен долететь\n         * до редюсера connected-react-router’а и актуализировать (синкнуть со стейтом в history) стейт router'a.\n         * После чего на изменение стейта срабатывает обработчик который обычно триггерит рендер react'а,\n         * но у connected-react-router’a есть свой такой, который нужен для того,\n         * чтобы синкать стейт router'a в сторе и стейт пакета history.\n         * То есть в обратную сторону. Вот в этом то месте и происходит рассинхрон.\n         *\n         * Из-за того что этот обработчик в connected-react-router'е не смотрит на action,\n         * который к нему прилетает (redux его не прокидывает), он пытается синкать\n         * состояния на каждый чих. Валидно убеждается в том, что состояния разные из-за того что history\n         * уже внесла в свой стейт изменения, а редюсер router'a еще не отработал, потому что\n         * до него влез другой action.\n         * После чего вызывает соответствующий метод у history, который снова меняет ее состояние\n         * и снова триггерит об этом экшен и все это еще больше запутывается.\n         **/\n        case LOCATION_CHANGE: {\n            const state = getState();\n\n            const currentPathname = selectPathname(state);\n            const nextPathname = action.payload.location.pathname;\n\n            /**\n             * Кейс LOCATION_CHANGE отвечает за сайд эффекты во время переходов\n             * между экранами.
