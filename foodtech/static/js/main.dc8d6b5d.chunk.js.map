После оповещает слушателей, подписанных на это.\n         * Внутри connected-react-router'а вызывается обработчик, который подписан\n         * на изменение стейта (локального, внутри библиотеки) history.\n         * Он dispatch'ит action, с типом @@router/LOCATION_CHANGE, который должен долететь\n         * до редюсера connected-react-router’а и актуализировать (синкнуть со стейтом в history) стейт router'a.\n         * После чего на изменение стейта срабатывает обработчик который обычно триггерит рендер react'а,\n         * но у connected-react-router’a есть свой такой, который нужен для того,\n         * чтобы синкать стейт router'a в сторе и стейт пакета history.\n         * То есть в обратную сторону. Вот в этом то месте и происходит рассинхрон.\n         *\n         * Из-за того что этот обработчик в connected-react-router'е не смотрит на action,\n         * который к нему прилетает (redux его не прокидывает), он пытается синкать\n         * состояния на каждый чих.
